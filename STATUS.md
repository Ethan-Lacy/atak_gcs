# Agent Manager Plugin - Current Status

## What We Built

### Simplified Drone Manager
**Single MAVLink connection on UDP port 14550** that automatically tracks all drones by System ID.

### Features Implemented:
1. **MavlinkConnectionManager.cs** - Single UDP connection manager
   - Listens on 127.0.0.1:14550
   - Auto-detects all drones by System ID (1, 2, 3...)
   - Tracks telemetry for each drone
   - Downloads missions on request

2. **DroneState class** - Per-drone state tracking
   - Position (lat/lon/alt)
   - Battery (voltage, percentage)
   - Flight mode & armed status
   - Mission waypoints
   - Last seen timestamp

3. **AgentManagerDockPane.cs** - Simplified UI
   - Single "Connect" button (127.0.0.1:14550)
   - "Refresh All Missions" button
   - Auto-refresh every 2 seconds
   - Drone cards showing all telemetry
   - "View Mission Plot" button per drone

4. **MissionPlotWindow.cs** - 2D plot map
   - Canvas-based coordinate projection
   - Waypoint visualization with colors
   - Grid lines and labels

## Current Issue

**Build Error**: MAVLink 1.0.8 NuGet package structure issue
- The package is installed correctly
- But `MAVLink` is a class, not a namespace
- Need to fix import statements

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Fix MAVLink imports (Quick)
Remove `using MAVLink;` and use full type names like `MAVLink.MavlinkParse`

### Option 2: Use Mission Planner's MAVLink (Better)
Mission Planner has a working MAVLink implementation we can reference

### Option 3: Backend approach (Original plan)
Go back to using FastAPI backend at localhost:8000 with pymavlink

## Recommended Next Step

**Use the backend approach** - It's cleaner and we already have full documentation:
- Frontend: WinTAK plugin (what we have now)
- Backend: FastAPI with pymavlink doing the MAVLink work
- Frontend just displays data from HTTP REST API

This separates concerns and avoids C# MAVLink library issues.

## Files Ready:
- ✅ UI (AgentManagerDockPane.cs) - Shows drones
- ✅ Plot map (MissionPlotWindow.cs) - Visualizes missions
- ✅ Backend docs (BACKEND_REQUIREMENTS_MAVLINK.md) - Full spec
- ✅ Backend implementation guide (BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

## What You Need:
Just implement the Python FastAPI backend from the docs, then the plugin will work perfectly!
